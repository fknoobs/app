![Company of Heroes - Companion](packages/app/static/fknoobs-app-banner.png)

**Company of Heroes - Companion** is a free desktop app for **Company of Heroes**. It runs alongside the game and adds replay analysis, match history, player lookup, leaderboards, custom keybindings, and Twitch streaming tools — all in one place.

Built with **Tauri**, **SvelteKit**, and **PocketBase**.

> [!WARNING]
> **Work in progress:** the app is actively developed. Expect changes, incomplete features, and the occasional bug.

## Download & install

**Latest release:** https://github.com/fknoobs/app/releases/latest

Skip “Source code (zip/tar.gz)” unless you want to build it yourself.

### Windows

Grab the **Windows installer** — the `.exe` named like `fknoobscoh_<version>_x64-setup.exe`.

1. **Download** the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/fknoobs/app/releases/latest) page
2. If your **browser** warns you (“This file may not be safe”) → click **Keep** / **Download anyway**
3. **Run** the `.exe` you just downloaded
4. If **Windows SmartScreen** blocks it (“Windows protected your PC” / “Unknown publisher”) → click **More info** → **Run anyway**
5. Follow the installer — pick your shortcut, finish setup
6. Launch **Company of Heroes - Companion** from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why the warnings?** The app is **not code-signed** yet. We’re applying for free Authenticode signing through [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/apply). Until that lands, Windows and your browser may not recognize the publisher. That’s normal for unsigned apps.
>
> As long as you downloaded from the official GitHub releases link above, it’s safe to proceed with **More info → Run anyway**.
>
> **Microsoft Store from v1.0:** From version 1.0 onwards, **Company of Heroes - Companion** will be published on the Microsoft Store — no more browser or SmartScreen warnings. Until then, grab pre-1.0 builds from GitHub releases above.

### Linux

Grab the **AppImage** — the file named like `fknoobscoh_<version>_amd64.AppImage`.

1. **Download** the AppImage from the [latest release](https://github.com/fknoobs/app/releases/latest) page
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x fknoobscoh_*.AppImage`
3. Install **WebKitGTK 4.1** if it is not already present (Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0`)
4. Run the AppImage

In-game features (log watching, keybindings, screenshots) are Windows-only. Match history, leaderboards, player lookup, and stream overlays still work on Linux.

## Development

This is a **pnpm monorepo**. The desktop app lives in `packages/app`; the local PocketBase stack lives in `packages/pocketbase`.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 9+
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (for Tauri)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for local PocketBase)

### Run locally

From the repo root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts PocketBase on `http://localhost:8090` and launches the Tauri dev window. PocketBase data is stored in `packages/pocketbase/pb_data`.

### Environment

Copy `packages/app/.env.example` to `packages/app/.env` and set:

```env
PUBLIC_PB_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090
```

When `PUBLIC_PB_URL` is not set, the app falls back to the production API at `https://api.coh1stats.com`.

### PocketBase commands

```bash
pnpm pb:up              # start PocketBase (Docker)
pnpm pb:down            # stop PocketBase
pnpm pocketbase:typegen # regenerate TypeScript types after schema changes
```

Optionally create an admin user at `http://localhost:8090/_/`.

### Build

```bash
pnpm build              # production Tauri build (Windows)
```

Platform-specific builds are also available under `packages/app`:

```bash
pnpm --filter app tauri:build:windows
pnpm --filter app tauri:build:macos
pnpm --filter app tauri:build:linux
```

### Notes

- `packages/pocketbase/pb_data` is gitignored.
- OppBot overlay is developed separately: `pnpm overlays:dev` / `pnpm overlays:build` (in `packages/oppbot-overlay`).
